# Data Analysis

## Objective
Analyze customer data to identify patterns and factors that influence loan eligibility, terms, and approval status.

## Instructions
1. Load and preprocess the customer data from the dataset.csv file.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of various features, including loan-specific attributes.
3. Identify key factors that influence loan approval, interest rates, and loan terms.
4. Analyze the relationship between customer attributes and loan outcomes (approval status, interest rate, loan term).
5. Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers.
6. Engineer relevant features that could improve loan recommendations, such as debt-to-income ratio categories or credit score ranges.
7. Prepare the data for use in the loan recommendation engine.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for feature engineering and preprocessing

## Output
- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Summary of key insights from the data analysis, including:
  - Factors most strongly correlated with loan approval
  - Relationship between credit score and interest rate
  - Impact of debt-to-income ratio on loan terms
  - Patterns in loan purpose and approval rates
- List of engineered features for the loan recommendation engine
- Visualizations of important relationships in the data
