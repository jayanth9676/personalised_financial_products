# Loan Recommendation Engine

## Objective
Develop an AI-powered engine that generates personalized loan recommendations based on customer data and bank products, focusing on approval likelihood, interest rates, and loan terms.

## Instructions
1. Design a machine learning model architecture suitable for loan recommendations (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Network).
2. Train the model using the preprocessed data from the Data Analysis step, with a focus on predicting:
   - Loan approval probability
   - Recommended interest rate
   - Suggested loan term
3. Implement a scoring system to rank loan products based on customer suitability and bank risk assessment.
4. Develop a function to generate personalized loan offers, including:
   - Suggested loan amount
   - Recommended interest rate
   - Optimal loan term
   - Estimated monthly payment
5. Implement explainable AI techniques to provide reasons for loan recommendations and any potential rejections.
6. Optimize the model for performance and accuracy, ensuring fair lending practices.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning models
- Scikit-learn for traditional machine learning models
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability
- Optuna for hyperparameter tuning

## Output
- Trained loan recommendation model capable of predicting approval, interest rates, and loan terms
- Function to generate personalized loan offers with multiple options
- Explanation module for loan recommendations and potential rejections
- Performance metrics on a test dataset, including accuracy, precision, recall, and fairness metrics
